      <description>Jane Doe is a fictional character that was made to illustrate different concepts related to data science. She&amp;rsquo;s used throughout the Chromebook Data Science Course Set. She&amp;rsquo;s particularly interested in both introducing the field of data science to anyone and everyone and teaching others how to do data science. Since she&amp;rsquo;s fictional, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any cool projects to tell you about or some interesting background information or interests to share, but if she did, she&amp;rsquo;d add them here.</description>
